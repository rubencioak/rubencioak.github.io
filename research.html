						In an environment with high coverage of collective agreements, unions and employers
							in large firms are able set the level of minimum wages that fit them best in terms
							of wages, and unemployment, because they can drive competitors out of the market,
							having detrimental effects on small firms. This paper develops a structural search and
							matching model with two-sided heterogeneity, minimum wages, and collective bargaining
							negotiations. The model is tested on Spanish data to explain why unions, and 
							surprisingly employers are willing to raise the minimum wage: because the gain labour 
							market power. In a nutshell, the rise in the minimum wage level causes costs increases 
							that push small firms out of the market, or leads them to fire workers not productive 
							enough to pay for the minimum wage; large firms are not so much affected but enjoy a 
							new stock of unemployed at their disposal and find it easier to fill vacancies; furthermore 
							employed workers have less alternative offers to bring the current employers into 
							competition for their services and be granted a pay raise. In a counterfactual exercise, 
							I show that in environments of low unemployment workers and employers would be 
							willing to raise the minimum wage level. A social planner would promote representation 
							of unions and employers in small firms to set the minimum wage level, and so reduce externalities.</p>

						Despite the advantages of holding monopoly power, unions rarely coordinate their wage demands across countries. 
							In this paper, I argue that the costs of coordination and externalities can explain such behaviour. I build
							a model of an international unionised oligopoly where a monopolist sells two differentiated products,
							produced in different countries in an integrated market. Monopolistic unions set wages in each country, 
							and the firm keeps the right-to-manage. If the domestic union raised its wage, the firm would substitute
							the production of the domestic good for the foreign one, reducing employment. The union would be worse off
							and it would have no incentives to deviate from the status quo. The foreign union experiments an increase
							in employment and wages, enjoying a positive externality. If they were to coordinate they could extract
							rents due to the internalisation of these externalities, but at a cost of coordination. The main results
							are: unions coordinate whenever products are very substitutable because the externalities are high enough
							to offset the costs; costs have to be relatively low for both unions to coordinate; and under the Stackelberg
							a leader both unions are better off thanks to double-marginalisation. </p>

						<a> With Emil Bustos</a> 
						<span id="abstract-link" class="abstract-click">| Abstract </span>
						<p class="abstract-text" style="display:none; font-size:.90em">
						After a historical major Spanish labour market reform in 2012, we find that the reduction 
							of severance payments and the setting of new contracts that facilitated contracting 
							were the most decisive policies to create jobs in the long term, despite wage cuts. 
							On the contrary, we find that policies related to collective bargaining, such as 
							firm-level priority in collective contracts, ultra-activity, and opt-out requirements 
							did not have an impact on job creation or wages. We derive these results by exploiting 
							two datasets: the first one, MCVL, has information about the complete employment 
							histories of workers and their monthly wages. The second, REGCON, has thorough information 
							about the clauses negotiated in collective agreements. By following workers with 
							collective contracts signed before and after the reform, we are able to measure 
							the effect of the reform on jobs and wages for the different policies enacted. </p>

						<p class="abstract-text" style="display:none; font-size:.90em">
						Using a new dataset covering all firm-level agreements signed in Spain between
							2010 and 2018, we shed light on whether greater representation of women at the
							bargaining table can foster family-friendly policies in the workplace. Our results
							are suggestive that if women’s needs become more salient during negotiations
							over company policies, this may make firms more family-friendly. </p>
